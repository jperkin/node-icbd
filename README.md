## What?

ICB daemon in node.js.

Oh, you mean what is ICB?  It's a really old, quirky chat system vaguely
similar to IRC, and for unfathomable reasons is still used by a number of open
source projects, not at all similar to that old worn out but still comfortable
pair of slippers we all wear, oh no :)

ICB protocol is documented [here](http://www.icb.net/_jrudd/icb/protocol.html)

## Why?

Fun!  Also I maintain [irssi-icb](https://github.com/jperkin/irssi-icb) so this
is a good way to learn ICB from the server point-of-view.

Also,
[i2cb](ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/chat/i2cb/README.html)
isn't very portable, so this may be of benefit to anyone who wants to run an
icb server on something other than \*BSD

## Current status?

You can join groups and chat and stuff, and of course /brick people.

There's not much else yet though...
